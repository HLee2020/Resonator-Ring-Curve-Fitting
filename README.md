# Resonator-Ring-Curve-Fitting
Curve fitting scripts for resonator rings

General fitting process flow: 
  First a general "fit by eye" using plotting scripts in order to determine a set of initial parameter values.
  Then, feed initial values into full model fitting script in order to run fitting algorithm.

Two versions of fitting scripts, with and without background.
